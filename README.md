# Formatore
- Formatore is a form-creation and form-filling application designed to be used locally and more conveniently than Google Forms.

# Features
- Create tables of arbitrary size with data types ranging between `TEXT`, `INTEGER`, and `REAL`.
- Update, delete, and preview tables all from the command-line.
- Export tables directly to CSV in merely three user inputs: 1) `e`; 2) `yourtablename`; 3) `youroutputfilename`.

# Installation
- Download the source code.
- Install Go.
- Within the highest-level directory  (`formatore`), run `go build`.
- Run the `formatore` executable.
- Optional: Create a symbolic link to the executable in your `bin` folder or other such folder on the path.
